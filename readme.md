# My First Webpage - Feedback Form

## Introduction
This is the very first webpage I have ever created. It is a simple feedback form designed for users to provide their feedback, including personal details, emotions, satisfaction levels, and more. Creating this page helped me get familiar with HTML structure, form elements, and some basic CSS styling. 

### Structure of the Page:
- The page is divided into a header, a feedback form, and a footer.
- At the top of the page is an image, styled to be circular with a centered alignment.
- The header contains a centered title "MY FEEDBACK FORM".
- The form itself has a variety of input fields:
  - Text fields for name, email, and phone number.
  - A password field for users to input their password (although not functional as this is a static page).
  - A predefined state field that is set to "Abia" and disabled.
  - A datalist dropdown allowing users to select or input their city.
  - Checkboxes to indicate various emotions users might be feeling.
  - Radio buttons for users to select their level of satisfaction with the service.
  - A text area for users to provide any additional comments.
  - File input for uploading a bio photo.
  - Date input to capture the user's birthday.
  - A location dropdown to select their country of residence.
- Finally, a submit button allows the user to submit the form (although there is no backend processing yet).

### Styling:
- The webpage uses a combination of inline styles and a block-level style to achieve a clean, centered layout.
- The background is set to a bright `blueviolet` color, and the form is centrally aligned with rounded corners.
- The image is set to a circular shape, providing a personal touch.

### Improvements I Would Consider:
- Adding validation and functionality on the backend to process form submissions.
- Making the form responsive for different screen sizes using media queries.
- Integrating JavaScript to enhance user interaction, such as validating form inputs or adding form confirmation dialogs.
